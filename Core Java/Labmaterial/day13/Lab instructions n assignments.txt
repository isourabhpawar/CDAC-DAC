Day 1
0. After the combined lab session ,
please download javadocs
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-doc-downloads.html

1. Go through today's sequence.txt
Revise n brush up on all mentioned concepts.

2. Solve this
5.1 Can you arrange Fruit,Apple,Orange,Mango in inheritance hierarchy ?
Use tight encapsulation.

5.2 Properties (instance variables)  : color : String , weight : double , name:String, fresh : boolean

5.3 Add suitable constructors.

5.4 Override  toString correctly to return state of all fruits (return only  : name ,color , weight )

5.5 Add a taste() method : public String taste()

For Fruit : Can you identify taste of any general fruit ?
So will you add a taste() with this definition : returns "no specific taste" OR can u apply abstraction?

Apple : should return  "sweet n sour"
Mango : should return  "sweet"
Orange : should return  "sour"

5.6 Add specific functionality , in the sub classes
In Mango : public void pulp() {Display name n color of the fruit + a mesg  creating  pulp!}
In Orange : public void juice() {Display name n weight of the fruit + a mesg extracting juice!}
In Apple : public void jam() {Display name of the fruit + a mesg  making jam!}


5.7 Add all of above classes under the package "com.app.fruits"
5.8 Create java application FruitBasket , with main method , as a tester , in com.app.tester package.
5.9 Prompt user for the basket size n create suitable data structure

5.10 Supply options
1. Add Mango
2. Add Orange
3. Add Apple
NOTE : You will be adding a fresh fruit in the basket , in all of above options.

4. Display names of all fruits in the basket.

5. Display name,color,weight , taste of all fresh fruits , in the basket.


6. Mark a fruit in a basket , as stale(=not fresh)
i/p : index 
o/p : error message (in case of invalid index) or mark it stale

7. Mark all sour fruits stale 
Hint : Use equals() method of the String class.

8. Invoke fruit specific functionality (pulp / juice / jam)
i/p : index
Invoke correct functionality (pulp / juice / jam)

10. Exit 


Day 2
In combined lab

1. import day2.1 in your workspace

2. After completing earlier work , try this.

 Beginning of a mini Project , to apply the learnt concepts.

Final Aim : To Create a Java application for customer management system.
(signIn , signup, update password, un subsribe user ....)

2.1 Customer HAS-A 
customer id(int) ,first name, last name (string),email(string),password(string),registrationAmount(double),dob(LocalDate),plan(ServicePlan : enum)

ServicePlan charges : 
SILVER : 1000 
GOLD : 2000
DIAMOND : 5000
PLATINUM : 10000

Depending on the plan chosen , customer will have to pay specific registration amount

customer id should be system generated , using auto increment.

Unique ID(Primary Key ) : email  (2 customers are SAME iff their email ids are same)

After reading above , can you create a Customer class ?
Try it !

Happy weekend !

Day 3

Student queries : 
1.Still not clear about downcasting , classcast exc n instanceof checking!
Will be revised in today's lab.
Then you will understand equals method : completely!
Refer : Emp , Mgr ,Worker , SalesMgr,HRMgr,TempWorker,PermanentWorker 
We will develop this n understand .

2. import day4.2 
We will revise COMPLETELY showroom management system.
(You can add break points n test the flow of execution)

3. Will try to complete : atleast the Customer class
n some validation rules !(Time permitting)

4. Revise later (self study time)
import day4.1
4.1 revise enums
4.2 revise generics


Day 5
1. import day5.1 in your workspace
Revise ArrayList API , with Integer type

Design 
Identify the classes/enums involved
1. ServicePlan : enum
ServicePlan charges : 
SILVER : 1000 
GOLD : 2000
DIAMOND : 5000
PLATINUM : 10000


2. Customer class (core class)
state(non static data members : instance vars)  : customer id(int) ,first name, last name (string),email(string),password(string),registrationAmount(double),dob(LocalDate),plan(ServicePlan : enum)
idGenerator : static
ctors 
1. all args ctor
2. PK based ctor

override : toString n equals

3. custom exception class
4. validation rules
no dup customers
Hint : public static void checkForDup(....)
{
api : contains
}

validate plan
reg amount must match with the plan
customer's age  must be > 21 : lab work

5. Tester


Day 6
In combined lab : 
1. Complete Day 5 assignment

2. In individual labs

2.2 import day6.2 , to revise
Iterators 
Vector

2. If time permits 
Solve : 
Sort customers as per asc order of email (natural ordering)

Day 7
In combined lab
1. MUST complete Day 5 assignment

2. Solve this
2.1 Sort customers as per asc order of email (natural ordering)
2.2 Sort customers as per dob n reg amount (custom ordering n anonymous inner class)

OPTIONAL work
If time permits , in the combined lab itself, solve this
In Customer class , add a field (instance var.) 
private LocalDate lastSubscriptionPaidDate;
Add Option(for customer) : Pay Subscription
It should update the date.

Add Option(for admin)  :  delete the customer details ,who have not paid the subscription(reg amount) for more than last 3  months 

In individual labs
import day7.1 n day 7.2 projects in your workspace.
1. Revise hashing algorithm : using diagram,code n readmes + hashing observations text file
(mandatory part n then optional part of the contract)

2. Try 
Emp class : add another data member.
private int deptId.
Rule : 2 emps are same iff id n dept id are same.
Store emp details in the HashSet .
try these combinations n check the o/p
same id , same dept id
same id , different dept id
different id , same dept id
different id , different dept id


Day 8

1. import day8.1 , in your workspace n revise CRUD operations with HashMap

2. Add these options
2.1 Fetch account summary
i/p : acct no
o/p : a/c details or error message via custom exception : invalid acct no

2.2 Display customer names having specified type of account (admin role)
i/p : account type
o/p : display names

2.3 Modify  transfer funds operation :
If dest a/c is locked(in active) , restore the balance in the src account

2.4 Add a method in BankAccount class to apply simple interest
i/ps : 

Add the option in tester : to apply simple interest to all saving type of accounts.

3. Revise additional generic syntax
Solve : generic questions 
(Skip the questions with super keyword)


0. Solve addAll , putAll , ArrayList(Collection c)

Interesting Hands on (practice of generics)
1. Write a method to Find average of  numbers from any List of any numbers (integer / float / double ...) n return it to the caller.
Test cases : AL<Integer> , Vector<Double> , LinkedList<Float> .....

2. Write a method to Find max element from List of any elements (integer / float / double/string/date/Customer/Vehicle ...) n return it to the caller.

Day 9
Good news!
NO new assignments !!!!
Revise complete week's work 
How ?
1. Keep Collection Overview diagram in front of you.
2. Compare List features with Set vs Map
3. Go through Iterator n ListIterator 
Exceptions associated with them
4. Sorting in Java : Comparable n Comparator
5. Map CRUD API 
Go through complete showroom management system (based on ArrayList)
Close the solution n try to solve it on your own , referring to readmes , your notes n mainly javadocs

6. Go through Banking system : HashMap based.
Close the solution n try to solve it on your own , referring to readmes , your notes n mainly javadocs

7. Revise ? extends and super
Solve "day9-data\day9_help\generic-questions.txt"


8.Revise today's code
import day9.1 n day 9.2
default n static methods in interface
functional interfaces
higher order functions


Day 10

1. import day10.1 
Revise I/O First.
1.1 Imperative approach 
1.2 Functional approach

2. 
More practicse of Functional programming using Functional Streams n lambda expression
Refer to ready code (students based scenario)
1. Display all student details from a student list
Hint : forEach  method of Iterable

2. Display all student details from a student map
Hint : forEach(BiConsumer)


3. Display all student details(list) sorted as per GPA 
Use custom ordering
Hint :list --> stream --> sorted(comp) --> forEach

4. Write a tester to print average of  gpa of students(map) for the specified subject
eg : i/p : subject
Hint : map --> Collection -- Stream --filter --mapToDouble --isPresent --getAsDouble



5 Print name of specified subject  topper


6 Print no of  failures for the specified subject chosen  from user.
(gpa < 5 : failed case)

7. Display student names of all the students , from a specified city.


Day 11

1. import day11.2 in your workspace
We will revise serialization n de-ser. in a combined lab.

2. Solve this (For lab exam practice)
Create Java application for emp management system
Requirements 
2.1 It should be able to store n restore emp details in a bin file using object streams
2.2 Emp details : id(string), first name , last name , dept(enum : RND,HR,SALES,FINANCE,PRODUCTION), joining date(LocalDate),salary
2.3 Let's say that : Company is only 3 years old. (so think of a validation rule on joining date)

2.4 Add required parsing / validation methods n custom exceptions

2.5 Ask yourself : where will you perform serialization(store detail) ---before terminating app(exit option)

 n de-serialization(restore details) ? -- in beginning of the app

Options
All CRUD operations MUST happen in constant time performance.
1. Hire new emp
2. List all emp details
3. Promote an emp
4. Delete emp details
5. Sort emps as per join date n display the same.
6. We can add many more options here.....
0. Exit

Design steps
1. core classes
1.1 Employee --state , ctor , toString, getters/setters(if required)
Will you need to override hashCode n equals , as per the contract ? NO (since HashMap uses key based hashCode n equals , Key class  : Integer : alrdy followed the contract
HOw ?
1.2. Department : enum

2. custom exc class : checked exc

3. utils : pkg
3.1 ValidationRules 
1. for join date
eg : i/f
static LocalDate validateDate(String date).....{...}
2. for enum

3.2 IOUtils : i/f
1. store
static void storeEmpDetails(String fileName, Map ...)
{
 .....
}
2. restore
static Map restoreEmpDetails(String fn)
{
 //ret empty map --in case of any exc(file not found exc)
o.w -- ret map restored from bin file
}


4. Tester 
try(sc) {
  1. restore details 
  exit=false
  while(!exit)
  {
    try {
    options --hire emp, display
    switch-case
    case 0 : exit=true
    store emp details 
  } catch-all
 }
}


Day 12

1. Revise Threads first
import day12_threads project in your workspace.
Revise .

2. Immediate hands on 
 Create a multi threaded app to solve these objective in a parallel manner
1. Accept range of nos from user : main
2. print all even nos : even_printer thrd
3. print all odd nos : odd_printer thrd
4. print average of the range supplied : averager thrd

Ensure no orphans


3. Complete (at least some options) Day 11's assignment


4. Do you want to check : JAR creation n class not found exc n invalid class exceptions ?


5. Optional work (If time permits , in the individual labs)
Apply threads to Collections n I/O (practical usage of threads.)

Create a multi threaded app to solve these objective in a parallel manner
1. Get a map of products with sample (hard coded) data

2. Sort the products as per date n save the sorted results (on separate lines) in the text file (u can replace it by bin file using serialization for extra practice)

3. Sort the products as per price n save the sorted results (on separate lines) in the text file (u can replace it by bin file using serialization for extra practice)

4. Ensure no orphans.


Day 13
In combined labs , revise synchronization first.
1. import day13.2 , to revise synchronized methods

2. import day13.3 , to revise synchronized blocks

3. Solve 
3.1 day13-data\day13_help\rdy code\thrd_unsafe_coll\ThreadUnsafeCollections.java
Guess what will happen ?
In case of a problem , fix it !

3.2 day13-data\day13_help\rdy code\tester\Test1.java
Replace ano inner class by lambda expression n guess the o/p
We will be adding lot many testers to understand synchronization inside out.

In individual labs
1. import day13.1 , to understand 
collection , I/O n threads.

2. import day13.4 to revise
user threads vs daemon threads

3. import day13.5 , to understand the problem , mentioned in today's sequence.txt
