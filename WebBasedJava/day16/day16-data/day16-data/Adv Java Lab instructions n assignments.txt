(by printing messages on the server console)

In individual labs , revise all of today's work .
Go through :readme Java EE.txt
If time permits : 
1. Create  advjava db in mysql 
Solve, using DB layered approach(Tester, DAO , DBUtils ,POJO,DB)

User signin 
Steps
1.Tables : users 
2. POJOs : User (voting status : boolean)
3 Create DBUtils: edit DB user name n pwd
openConnection : 
closeConnection

4. DAO
4.1 UserDao
User  authenticateUser(String email,String pwd) throws SqlException
4.2 Implementation class
5. Write a tester for testing this
(main class n not a servlet !)

Day 2
1. import day2.1 as existing project in your workspace
(Edit DBUtils as per your DB settings)

Revise
1.1 Servlet-JDBC integration
1.2 Page Navigation : redirect scenario
(MJUST check the net traffic: inspect option)

2. Hands on
Add a Cookie to perform session tracking.

3. MUST solve : New Voter registration
Add a link on login.html , New Voter
Clicking on link , show Voter registration form
Think about which request data , you will add in the form ?
Options : id , first_name , last_name , email             , password , dob        , status , role
Submit it to RegisterVoterServlet
Here you add a validation rule. 
Voter's age > 21 . If yes insert voter details in DB (using DAO n POJO , DBUtils)
Otherwise , give suitable error mesg.

4. In the individual labs , with internet connection :
EVERYONE MUST import the hibernate template project  , as existing Maven Project :
"day6_data\day6_help\hibernate help\template project\test_hibernate_basic"
to download all hibernate dependencies
(You WON'T be able to work tomorrow , with hibernate otherwise!)

Day 7
Wait for instructions please !

1. If you have not imported , import "test_hibernate_basic" as existing maven project
1.1 Test bootstrapping of hibernate
1.2 Auto creation of Table
1.3 insertion of the record.

2. Continuation of IPL assignment : if time permits !


Day 8

1. import day8.1 in your workspace , as existing maven project
Edit hibernate.cfg.xml , as per your db user name n password

2. Mandatory assignment (you can continue in the same as day8.1 or day7_lab, completely your choice)

2.1 
Create Student pojo 
properties : 
 studentId : Integer (PK) ,first name , last name,email,password,course(enum with admission fees), dob : LocalDate 
Add JPA annotations
Add <mapping> entry
Test proper creation of "students" table.
Refer to our Employee POJO for annotations.

2.2 
Solve this
1. Student registration (ids should start from 1001 onwards, HOW will you achieve it ????)
After creating the students table
alter table students auto_increment 1001
i/p : student details (first name , last name,email,password,course(enum),dob )
o/p : Reg successful , with student id(auto generated from hibernate, 1001 onwards) 
or failure mesg.

2. Student login
i/p : email , password
o/p : A mesg : login successful , with student details lifted from db
or failure mesg.
Hint : JPQL  -- createQuery , setParams: 2, getSingleResult

3. Get all students from a specific course
i/p : course name
Display list of students from the course
Hint : jpql ,createQuery , setParam: 1, getResultList


4. Change course
i/p : student id(int) , course name
o/p : in case of invalid id --error mesg
in case of success : course updation message
Hint : session.get(...) -->null chking --not null --> persistent student
set new course  
------------------

Maven Clean Up instructions (If the project is not working properly!!)
1. Force update the project
R Click on project --Maven --Update Project (Force update it!)

2.  If you are having problems still , in downloading the Maven hibernate dependencies , 
Use Maven clean option n Project clean

3. Worst case , if it still doesn't work 
Exit STS IDE
Delete maven <repository> folder 
Enter STS 
Force update Maven project

Day 9
1. Complete pending work of Day 8.

Department 1<---->* Employee

4. Optional BUT Recommended for your clarity n confidence
Author 1<----->* Book
Use BaseEntity n try @MappedSuperclass

Tables to  be generated by hibernate (books n authors)

4.1 Author :id first name ,last name , email(unique) , pwd + ???????
Book : id,title(unique), price + ?????

4.2 Do not add any mapping related annotations n observe the exception
4.3 Fix the problem
4.4 Hibernate will generated an additional table.
Why ??
 How to generate only 2 tables : (books n authors)

4.5 FK column name should be : author_id 
How ?

4.6 Add dao layers n tester for the following
1. Add new Author
i/p : author details
o/p : a mesg

2. Add a book written by an author
i/p : book details + existing author email
o/p : a mesg


3. To test cascading 
i/p : new author details + 3 new book details
o/p : a mesg



Day 10
1. Revise JPA associations
Highlights : 
one to many bi dir associaton (mappedBy , orphanRemoval n fetch type)

one to one uni dir mapping (@MapsId)

Mandatory Hands on 
2. Integrate web app + hibernate
(import template project : web_maven_hibernate)
I hope it's already done!
Layers : JSP --Java Bean --Hibernate based DAO --HibernateUtils --Entities --DB

Solve : IPL assignment
(Refer to day6_ipl)
We had done it with JSP-JB , but with JDBC based DAO n oridinary POJOs
We are going to port it to hibernate + web app

3. OPTIONAL 
3.1 Cascade on update 
Change dept location n change salary of emps 

3.2 Display all department details 
(Before that set fetch type as eager)
Observe : select n+1 issue

3.3 Display all employees from a specific city
i/p : city
o/p : list of emps



Day 11
1. Continue with  IPL assignment n complete it!
1.1 Write a test case for the DAO layer
1.2 Complete Java Bean n JSP

Hints for Completion of IPL assignment
1. Example URL after submitting the form : 
http://localhost:8080/day10_lab/process_form.jsp?myTeam=2&fn=a&fn=b&dob=1999-06-13&avg=56.78&wickets=10

2.Add a method  in Team DAO to fetch selected team details
Team getTeamDetails(long teamId);

3. In IPLBean class
3.1 Add bean properties having MATCHING names with request params
(choose correct data types)
3.2 Add getters n setters for every property
3.3 Add a B.L method to first validate n add player
eg : public String validateAndAddPlayer() {
Parse the props (eg dob) 
Invoke validation rule/s  --in case success --invoke dao's method to add the player n return success mesg to the caller.
o.w : return err mesg to the caller.
}

4. In process_form.jsp 
<jsp:setPropert property="*" name="ipl"/>
n invoke B.L method of IPL bean using EL syntax.



2. BLOB handling (Ref : sequence of day9_data\day9_help)
2.1 Store emp image in DB
i/p : emp id n image file path

2.2 ReStore emp image in DB
i/p : emp id n o/p image file path

3. Session's get vs load methods
Ref : Today's diagrams

4. Optional work : 
You can either test it using testers or test case(@Test)

Launch new project
Assign emp to the project
list all emps from a project
Remove emp from the project
list all projects for the emp
